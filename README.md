# ComputerVision-ObjectDetection
This Repo. will contain all the project related to Image Processing in Neural Networks or Opencv 
VideoCall App :
In this I will explain about my App created using OpenCv Socket Programming

Modules Used : 

Opencv :OpenCV is the huge open-source library for the computer vision, machine learning, and image processing and now it plays a major role in real-time operation which is very important in today's systems. By using it, one can process images and videos to identify objects, faces, or even handwriting of a human.

Struct :The struct module in Python is used to convert native Python data types such as strings and numbers into a string of bytes and vice versa. What this means is that users can parse binary files of data stored in C structs in Python.

It is used mostly for handling binary data stored in files or from network connections, among other sources.

Socket :Socket programming is a way of connecting two nodes on a network to communicate with each other. One socket(node) listens on a particular port at an IP, while other socket reaches out to the other to form a connection. Server forms the listener socket while client reaches out to the server.

They are the real backbones behind web browsing. In simpler terms there is a server and a client.

Pickle :Python pickle module is used for serializing and de-serializing python object structures. The process to converts any kind of python objects (list, dict, etc.) into byte streams (0s and 1s) is called pickling or serialization or flattening or marshalling. We can converts the byte stream (generated through pickling) back into python objects by a process called as unpickling.
